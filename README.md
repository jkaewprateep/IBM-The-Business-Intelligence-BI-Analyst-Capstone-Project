## Business data model ##

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Oneway of creating business data mode with measurement level is by performing the standard method and the mathematics method can perform simulation, estimation values prediction, or responsive message in similar pattern and recognition. </br>
🦤💬 🥕🥕🥕 Good carrots have symmetric shapes because they provide good content with expected results, they found facts that because soil content creates the symmetric shape of the carrots then agriculture provides the correct nutrients and ingredients. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Discovering this method is by analyzing soil content, nutrients, and lights when agriculture performs carrot development for a long period or by discovering of the bacteria and fungi living organism in soil content. </br>
🦤💬 That should be both since the correct environment develops good activities and environment living organisms that support good content and agriculture development. In fact, performing experiments by adding sugar acids to plant fungi living organisms can create relationships that can determine the product content results, weight, and shape. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ I thought that is because of GMOs because of everything looks good by the method and is easy to perform. I read this in the newspaper which people read and skipped but it is also in English lessons where they are teaching in school, after the lesson I found news on television about how they planted cubic watermelons, pineapples for food cans, and limes orange fruits for food production. 🍉🍍🍊 <br>
🧸💬 Social media campaigns and customer surveys reveal that in fact we watch them for entertainment only and we may recognize of the fact how they can produce but we do not make any difference because they are already on the shelves and marketing is performing selection for us. We are buying from supermarket and management market area. </br>

## Continuous values and incrementation ## 

🐐💬 Data exploration reveals the truth that multiple times of activities can indicate the significance or identity of the function, linear logarithms are a scaling technique to make data change significant when occurrence can appear in many forms. One of them is the frequency graph when its behavior is in a period where we can determine who had the most and least effects from the activity in our observations. </br>
🐯💬 So we can have our traditional seats because ladies should be in the first row and boys protect our women as culture INFO. </br>
🐐💬 Now I can observe by sight who is the most diligent ‼️‼️ </br>

🦁💬 Have you noticed that everyone continuing on the same pattern will benefit the theater by screaming loud sounds HaHaHa +++  </br>

## Data Cleaning and Data preparation ##

🦭💬 Patterns and standardization is a personal method technique and it is a time-consuming process where many applications try to create applications with data patterns to create output datasets with clean data but there are always data that need to be learned, re-formats, standardized, and patterns mapping by the target or application flows balance. </br>
👧💬 🎈 Data must be correct by its meaning as in the example of file storage document that is valuable since they are true proven of source and their items in the references 🗄️🗂️ </br>
🧸💬  In fact you can store anything as long as you want but they can be used when and only when they can have reference existing or proven they are true by aligned of the same or contrast, I found this when I watched the Harry Potter movie in the documentary room where everything is massive after the fighting how they recover the damages documents ⁉️ </br>
🦭💬 Do you have the same meaning that you have a reference ⁉️ That is specific of it to be true. </br>

## Pivot Table ##

🧸💬 A pivot table is important since the period is a good phase shift for the calculation of events and response for tracking of action and re-action in real life, accounting also knows period (T) for predicting current, and target statistics measurement values from providing relationship of the target scope in the study experiment. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Common functions are built on the time-scale assumption except for aggregation functions because of our understanding and the pivot table can perform on both time-scales and linear scales to provide aggregation function example SUM, COUNT, or dimension functions Dot product, linear scales function and etc. </br>
🐐💬 That is important when creating a summation table, two-dimensional table, and contrast table for graphs, nowadays graph input accepts tabular data information input formats. </br>

🐣💬 Banana Tango Sieble is not a code word but an example of the problem domain that the Pivot table is solved fast in linear scales problem domain including telecommunications message and translation Tall-short word sentences. </br>
🦭💬 🍌 That is not the top performance there is a definition of Bravo now you have the banana ‼️ </br>

👧💬 🎈 At each time of the table, the Pivot collection of the kinetic energy and return it balance by the ideal of the instrument the short-tall problem domain is solved by finding different of the input sequence and working on a new input different, save of the most meaning and transform. Most repeating words or alphabets do not need more than one size of character to replace and continue new conversation input creating more meaning by the learner's experiences. </br>

## Data Query ##

🧸💬 Working with entails engagement problem is the patch-panels and specific balance of the input-output indicators, similar to selecting query columns and grouping but performed by the nature function of SQL statement command the pre-aggregate and post aggregate function. In the path panel, the standard is connected to all wired with specific indicators and labels when tools and instruments are selected of the bandwidths channels they required for work with the configuration function but it is special when they can have a reserved port with the communication port that support different synchronized speeds that is one of the high-end integrated communication boxes where the merged into telecommunication box. <br>
🐐💬 Entails grouping is the meaning of command information they communicated before but it is used in their development scopes when you can imagine the sub-blocks inside the connectors blocks that support communication of current, different channels and synchronous in the same box for unitilize id its speeds. </br>

🦭💬 Who had the entails problem needs to work on the assignment ... communication is important when you have the same message from both the communicator and the receiver. </br>
🧸💬⁉️ Sinor what is the door gate entail meaning ⁉️ </br>
🦭💬 Do not cracks between the door. </br>

## Data Analysis ##

🐑💬 ➰ The data analysis is similar to when you discovered the fossils first you may find the perfect piece match of what you are looking for continue working you may find the absolute path of your work about this year. Continue you may find new discoveries of the skill types and try to compare scales and what are they eating, further you find a whole piece of data and what they look like and now you are thinking about it or dreaming about it what is exactly of your discover and how the innovative ideas about it. </br>
🥺💬 I heart when somebody says Ammonites or sandstorms they are from the Historic Discovery Channel and they understand the same meaning since the satellite revealed the truth about both sides of the sandstorms. Both are discovered. </br>

🧸💬 Selection and scope of works both small historical discover are more important than the secrete of the sandstorms that take lives in an instance⁉️ </br> 
🐨🎁🎵🎶 Not except discovered of Chromanone Tomahawks </br>

## Data Visualization ##

🦁💬 The visual-eyes-sation is not creating of new bigger eyes but information and detail displayed by the contrast and sense of the information, categorizing is a way to tell your group identity without telling anybody known from the communications and it is not a direct enchant of your eyes size but known your infomration from its column with saying communication. </br>
🦄💬 I'd like to have green-water because the plant can grow from protection resources. ( water shadow and forest walker, the magics the gathering card games )  </br>
