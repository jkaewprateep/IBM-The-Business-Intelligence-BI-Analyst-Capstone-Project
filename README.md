## Business data model ##

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Oneway of creating business data mode with measurement level is by performing the standard method and the mathematics method can perform simulation, estimation values prediction, or responsive message in similar pattern and recognition. </br>
🦤💬 🥕🥕🥕 Good carrots have symmetric shapes because they provide good content with expected results, they found facts that because soil content creates the symmetric shape of the carrots then agriculture provides the correct nutrients and ingredients. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Discovering this method is by analyzing soil content, nutrients, and lights when agriculture performs carrot development for a long period or by discovering of the bacteria and fungi living organism in soil content. </br>
🦤💬 That should be both since the correct environment develops good activities and environment living organisms that support good content and agriculture development. In fact, performing experiments by adding sugar acids to plant fungi living organisms can create relationships that can determine the product content results, weight, and shape. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ I thought that is because of GMOs because of everything looks good by the method and is easy to perform. I read this in the newspaper which people read and skipped but it is also in English lessons where they are teaching in school, after the lesson I found news on television about how they planted cubic watermelons, pineapples for food cans, and limes orange fruits for food production. 🍉🍍🍊 <br>
🧸💬 Social media campaigns and customer surveys reveal that in fact we watch them for entertainment only and we may recognize of the fact how they can produce but we do not make any difference because they are already on the shelves and marketing is performing selection for us. We are buying from supermarket and management market area. </br>

## Continuous values and incrementation ## 

🐐💬 Data exploration reveals the truth that multiple times of activities can indicate the significance or identity of the function, linear logarithms are a scaling technique to make data change significant when occurrence can appear in many forms. One of them is the frequency graph when its behavior is in a period where we can determine who had the most and least effects from the activity in our observations. </br>
🐯💬 So we can have our traditional seats because ladies should be in the first row and boys protect our women as culture INFO. </br>
🐐💬 Now I can observe by sight who is the most diligent ‼️‼️ </br>

🦁💬 Have you noticed that everyone continuing on the same pattern will benefit the theater by screaming loud sounds HaHaHa +++  </br>

## Data Cleaning and Data preparation ##

🦭💬 Patterns and standardization is a personal method technique and it is a time-consuming process where many applications try to create applications with data patterns to create output datasets with clean data but there are always data that need to be learned, re-formats, standardized, and patterns mapping by the target or application flows balance. </br>
👧💬 🎈 Data must be correct by its meaning as in the example of file storage document that is valuable since they are true proven of source and their items in the references 🗄️🗂️ </br>
🧸💬  In fact you can store anything as long as you want but they can be used when and only when they can have reference existing or proven they are true by aligned of the same or contrast, I found this when I watched the Harry Potter movie in the documentary room where everything is massive after the fighting how they recover the damages documents ⁉️ </br>
🦭💬 Do you have the same meaning that you have a reference ⁉️ That is specific of it to be true. </br>
